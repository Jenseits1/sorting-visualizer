# Sorting Visualizer

Sorting Visualizer is an interactive sorting algorithm visualizer built to help users understand how different sorting algorithms work

## Features

-   **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**  
    Visualize popular sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and others

-   **Real-time Speed Control**  
    Adjust the speed of the visualization on the fly to observe each step more clearly

-   **Dynamic Array Size Control**  
    Choose different array sizes to see how sorting algorithms handle varying data sets

-   **Start/Stop Controls**  
    Pause and resume the visualization to examine specific operations and transitions

-   **Randomized Array Generation**  
    Generate new random arrays to test how algorithms perform on different inputs

-   **Optimized Canvas Animation**  
    Smooth, high-performance animations running at up to 100+ frames per second using HTML5 Canvas

-   **Progress Bar**  
    Track the algorithm’s progress through a visual indicator of sorting completion

-   **Interactive Sound Effects**  
    Real-time sound feedback based on the frequency of elements being compared, with the ability to toggle sound on or off

## Technologies Used

-   **Next.js** — React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
-   **TypeScript** — Provides static typing to improve code reliability and maintainability
-   **Chakra UI** — Component library for building accessible, responsive user interfaces
-   **Zustand** — State management library used to manage UI interactions and algorithm states
-   **HTML5 Canvas** — Used for rendering fast and efficient visual animations
